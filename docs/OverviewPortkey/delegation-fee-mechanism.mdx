# Delegation Fee Mechanism

Unlike some smart contract wallets that charge users fees when creating or using wallets, Portkey employs a unique delegation payment mechanism. This mechanism allows third parties to act as delegatees to pay transaction fees for users, enabling users to use smart contract wallets at minimal cost.

Currently, Portkey offers three specific types of delegation payments based on user behavior:

| Type       | Requirements                                                                                 | Types of transactions included                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type one   | delegatees will cover the transaction fees regardless of users' balances.                    | Account sign-up, login, and login by scanning QR code         |
| Type two   | delegatees only need to cover the transaction fees when the users don't have enough balance. | Adding/removing guardians, and changing login accounts.       |
| Type three | delegatees will never cover the transaction fees.                                            | Token transfers, cross-chain transactions, NFT creation, etc. |
