## What is Portkey DID solution?

Portkey DID is the process of verifying users' Web2 accounts, and assigning managing addresses to be linked to their accounts, and further control and manage the private keys of user's wallet accounts being stored on users' local device via the managing addresses.
It is also the key mechanism for social recovery. Whenever a user logs in for the first time on a device or logs back in after logging out, he needs to verify himself in a decentralized way, to ensure no one has control of his account.
The identity verification process can be divided into two parts. First, the user’s social account needs to be verified by “verifiers,” the external service providers sending verification codes to the corresponding social accounts of the guardians, and guardians will release approvals for account registration or login depending on the verification results. Secondly, when the number of guardians is no more than three and all provide approval, or a proportional percentage of the total number of guardians provide approval when the number of guardians exceeds three, a manager address on the device will be generated and linked to the users’ AA wallet account, which can then be controlled.
