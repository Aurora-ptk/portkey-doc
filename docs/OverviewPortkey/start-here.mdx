# Start here

## Before you start

This documentation aims to facilitate you to integrate Portkey SDK, to create digital assets as well as to build on aelf, in the fastest way possible.
For those of you who are not familiar with Portkey, it wouldn't hurt to have a read of the overview.
If you need step-by-step assistance, you can go to Quickstart Guides for SDKs of Portkey and other solutions related to Web3 BUIDL.
For those of you who need to skip the guides, and look for SDKs directly, go to "SDKs" where all kinds of SKDs are collected there.
For those of you looking for certain APIs, "API references" are where to go.
Environmental Configuration and Troubleshooting are also provided for your convenience.
